Class Insomnia Disorder
Diagnostic-Criteria 780.52 (G47.00)
A. a predominant complaint of dissatisfaction witli sleep quantity or quality, associated
with one (or more) of the following symptoms:
1. Difficulty initiating sleep. (In children, this may manifest as difficulty initiating sleep
without caregiver intervention.)
2. Difficulty maintaining sleep, characterized by frequent awakenings or problems returning
to sleep after awakenings. (In children, this may manifest as difficulty returning
to sleep without caregiver intervention.)
3. Early-morning awakening with inability to return to sleep.
B. The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
educational, academic, behavioral, or other important areas of functioning.
C. The sleep difficulty occurs at least 3 nights per week.
D. The sleep difficulty is present for at least 3 months.
E. The sleep difficulty occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep.
F. The insomnia is not better explained by and does not occur exclusively during the
course of another sleep-wake disorder (e.g., narcolepsy, a breathing-related sleep disorder,
a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, a parasomnia).
G. The insomnia is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug
of abuse, a medication).
H. Coexisting mental disorders and medical conditions do not adequately explain the predominant
complaint of insomnia.

Diagnostic-Features
The essential feature of insomnia disorder is dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality
with complaints of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. The sleep complaints are accompanied
by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, 
Specify if:
With non-sleep disorder mental comorbidity, including substance use disorders
With other medical comorbidity
Specify if:
Episodic: Sy(nptoms last at least 1 month but less than 3 months.
Note: Acute and short-term insomnia (i.e., symptoms lasting less than 3 months but othenA/ise
meeting all criteria with regard to frequency, intensity, distress, and/or impairment)
should be coded as an other specified insomnia disorder.
Prevalence
Population-based estimates indicate that about one-third of adults report insomnia symptoms,
10%-15% experience associated daytime impairments, and 6% -10% have symptoms
that meet criteria for insonmia disorder. Insomnia disorder is the most prevalent of all
sleep disorders. ù;i primary care settings, approximately 10%-20% of individuals complain
Development-and-Course
The onset of insomnia symptoms can occur at any time during life, but the first episode is
more common in young adulthood. Less frequently, insomnia begins in childhood or adolescence.
In women, new-onset insomnia may occur during menopause and persist even
after other symptoms (e.g., hot flashes) have resolved. Insomnia may have a late-life onset,
which is often associated with the onset of other health-related conditions.

Risk-and-Prognostic-Factors
While the risk and prognostic factors discussed in this section increase vuhierability to insomnia,
sleep disturbances are more likely to occur when predisposed individuals are exposed
to precipitating events, such as major life events (e.g., illness, separation) or less
severe but more chronic daily stress. Most individuals resume normal sleep patterns after
the initial triggering event has disappeared, but others—perhaps those more vulnerable to
insomnia—continue experiencing persistent sleep difficulties. Perpetuating factors such as
poor sleep habits, irregular sleep scheduling, and the fear of not sleeping feed into the insomnia
problem and may contribute to a vicious cycle that may induce persistent insomnia.
Temperamental. Anxiety or worry-prone personality or cognitive styles, increased arousal
predisposition, and tendency to repress emotions can increase vulnerability to insomnia.
Environmental. Noise, light, uncomfortably high or low temperature, and high altitude
may also increase vulnerability to insomnia.
Genetic and physiological. Female gender and advancing age are associated with increased
vulnerability to insomnia. Disrupted sleep and insomnia display a familial disposition.
The prevalence of insomnia is higher among monozygotic twins relative to
dizygotic twins; it is also higher in first-degree family members compared with the general
population. The extent to which this link is inherited through a genetic predisposition,
learned by observations of parental models, or established as a by-product of another psychopathology
remains undetermined.
Course modifiers. Deleterious course modifiers include poor sleep hygiene practices
(e.g., excessive caffeine use, irregular sleep schedules).
Gender-Reiated Diagnostic issues
Insomnia is a more prevalent complaint among females than among males, with first onset
often associated with the birth of a new child or with menopause. Despite higher prevalence
among older females, polysomnographic studies suggest better preservation of
sleep continuity and slow-wave sleep in older females than in older males.
Diagnostic iVlaricers
Polysomnography usually shows impairments of sleep continuity (e.g., increased sleep latency
and time awake after sleep onset and decreased sleep efficiency [percentage of time
in bed asleep] and may show increased stage 1 sleep and decreased stages 3 and 4 sleep.
The severity of these sleep impairments does not always match the individual's clinical
presentation or subjective complaint of poor sleep, as individuals with insomnia often underestimate
sleep duration and overestimate wakefulness relative to polysomnography.
Quantitative electroencephalographic analyses may indicate that individuals with insomnia
have greater high-frequency electroencephalography power relative to good sleepers
both around the sleep onset period and during non-rapid eye movement sleep, a feature
suggestive of increased cortical arousal. Individuals with insomnia disorder may have a
lower sleep propensity and typically do not show increased daytime sleepiness on objective
sleep laboratory measures compared with individuals without sleep disorders.
Other laboratory measures show evidence, although not consistently, of increased
arousal and a generalized activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (e.g., increased
cortisol levels, heart rate variability, reactivity to stress, metabolic rate). In general,
findings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased physiological and cognitive
arousal plays a significant role in insomnia disorder.
Individuals with insomnia disorder may appear either fatigued or haggard or, conversely,
overaroused and "wired." However, there are no consistent or characteristic
abnormalities on physical examination. There may be an increased incidence of stress-
related psychophysiological symptoms (e.g., tension headache, muscle tension or pain,
gastrointestinal symptoms).
Functional-Consequences-of Insomnia-Disorder
Interpersonal, social, and occupational problems may develop as a result of insomnia or
excessive concern with sleep, increased daytime irritability, and poor concentration. Decreased
attention and concentration are common and may be related to higher rates of accidents
observed in insomnia. Persistent insomnia is also associated with long-term
consequences, including increased risks of major depressive disorder, hypertension, and
myocardial infarction; increased absenteeism and reduced productivity at work; reduced
quality of life; and increased economic burden.
Differential-Diagnosis
Normal sleep variations. Normal sleep duration varies considerably across individuals.
Some individuals who require little sleep ("short sleepers") may be concerned about their
sleep duration. Short sleepers differ from individuals with insomnia disorder by the lack of
difficulty falling or staying asleep and by the absence of characteristic daytime symptoms
(e.g., fatigue, concentration problems, irritability). However, some short sleepers may desire
or attempt to sleep for a longer period of time and, by prolonging time in bed, may create an
insomnia-like sleep pattern. Clinical insomnia also should be distinguished from normal,
age-related sleep changes. Insomnia must also be distinguished from sleep deprivation due
to inadequate opportunity or circumstance for sleep resulting, for example, from an emergency
or from professional or family obligations forcing the individual to stay awake.
Situational/acute insomnia. Situational/acute insomnia is a condition lasting a few days
to a few weeks, often associated with life events or with changes in sleep schedules. These
acute or short-term insomnia symptoms may also produce significant distress and interfere
with social, personal, and occupational functioning. When such symptoms are frequent
enough and meet all other criteria except for the 3-month duration, a diagnosis of
other specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insomnia disorder is made.
Delayed sleep phase and shift work types of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder.
Individuals with the delayed sleep phase type of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder report
sleep-onset insomnia only when they try to sleep at socially normal times, but they do
not report difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep when their bed and rising times are
delayed and coincide with their endogenous circadian rhythm. Shift work type differs from
insomnia disorder by the history of recent shift work.
Restless legs syndrome. Restless legs syndrome often produces difficulties initiating
and maintaining sleep. However, an urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleasant
leg sensations are features that differentiate this disorder from insomnia disorder.
Breathing-related sleep disorders. Most individuals with a breathing-related sleep disorder
have a history of loud snoring, breathing pauses during sleep, and excessive daytime
sleepiness. Nonetheless, as many as 50% of individuals with sleep apnea may also report
insomnia symptoms, a feature that is more common among females and older adults.
Narcolepsy. Narcolepsy may cause insomnia complaints but is distinguished from insomnia
disorder by the predominance of symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy,
sleep paralysis, and sleep-related hallucinations.
Comorbidity
Insomnia is a common comorbidity of many medical conditions, including diabetes, coronary
heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and
other chronic pain conditions. The risk relationship appears to be bidirectional: insomnia
increases the risk of medical conditions, and medical problems increase the risk of insomnia.
The direction of the relationship is not always clear and may change over time; for this
reason, comorbid insomnia is the preferred terminology in the presence of coexisting insomnia
with another medical condition (or mental disorder).
Relationship-to-Other-Classifications
Sleep Disorders
There are several distinct insomnia phenotypes relating to the perceived source of the insomnia
that are recognized by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition
(ICSD-2). These include psychophysiological insomnia, idiopathic insomnia, sleep-state misperception,
and inadequate sleep hygiene. Despite their clinical appeal and heuristic value, there is
limited evidence to support these distinct phenotypes.
